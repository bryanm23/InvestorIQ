# Authentication Persistence on Page Refresh

## Problem

Users are getting logged out when they refresh the page in the frontend demo application. This creates a poor user experience and disrupts the user's workflow.

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the authentication flow in the application, the issue has been identified in how the application handles token verification and refresh on page reload.

### Current Authentication Flow

1. **Authentication Storage Mechanism**: 
   - The app uses a combination of HTTP-only cookies (for tokens) and localStorage (for user data)
   - When a user logs in, their data is stored in localStorage and tokens are stored in cookies

2. **Page Refresh Flow**:
   - On page refresh, the app tries to retrieve user data from localStorage
   - It also calls `verifyAuth()` to verify authentication with the server
   - If verification fails, it tries to refresh the token

3. **The Bug**:
   - In the `verifyAuth()` function in `AuthContext.js`, when there's an error during verification, the app only attempts to keep the user logged in if there's user data in localStorage:
   ```javascript
   catch (err) {
     console.error('Auth verification error:', err);
     setError('Authentication verification failed');
     // Don't logout on network errors if we have a user in localStorage
     if (!localStorage.getItem('user')) {
       logout();
     }
   }
   ```
   - Similarly, in the `refreshToken()` function, it has the same condition:
   ```javascript
   catch (err) {
     console.error('Token refresh error:', err);
     // Don't logout on network errors if we have a user in localStorage
     if (!localStorage.getItem('user')) {
       logout();
     }
   }
   ```

4. **The Root Cause**:
   - The app is correctly loading user data from localStorage on refresh, but then it's making a network request to verify the authentication
   - If there's any network error or if the backend is temporarily unavailable, the verification fails
   - The app then tries to refresh the token, which can also fail for the same reason
   - Even though there's user data in localStorage, the app is logging out the user on these network errors
   - The verification process doesn't properly distinguish between network errors and actual authentication failures

## Solution

The solution is to make the authentication flow more resilient to network errors and to improve the user experience by maintaining authentication state across page refreshes.

### Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Modify the `verifyAuth()` and `refreshToken()` functions to be more tolerant of network errors
   - Only log out the user if there's a clear authentication failure, not just any network error

2. **Offline Support**:
   - Allow the app to function in a "degraded" mode when offline, using the cached user data
   - Only attempt to verify with the server when online

3. **Prioritize Local Storage**:
   - Set the user from localStorage first before attempting verification
   - This ensures the user sees their data immediately on page load

### Code Changes

Here are the specific code changes needed in `AuthContext.js`:

```javascript
// Verify authentication with the server
const verifyAuth = async () => {
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    // First, check if we have a user in localStorage
    const storedUser = localStorage.getItem('user');
    if (storedUser) {
      // Set the user from localStorage first
      setUser(JSON.parse(storedUser));
    }

    // Then try to verify with the server
    const response = await fetch('/front_to_back_sender.php', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ action: 'verify_auth' }),
      credentials: 'include' // Include cookies
    });

    const data = await response.json();

    if (data.status === 'success') {
      // User is authenticated, update with latest data
      setUser(data.user);
      localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(data.user));
    } else if (data.status === 'error' && data.message?.includes('expired')) {
      // Token expired, try to refresh
      await refreshToken();
    } else if (data.status === 'error' && data.message?.includes('invalid')) {
      // Clear invalid authentication
      logout();
    }
    // For other errors, keep the user logged in if we have localStorage data
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Auth verification error:', err);
    // Don't logout on network errors if we have a user in localStorage
    // This is already correct, but we should make sure the error is handled properly
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};

// Refresh access token using refresh token
const refreshToken = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/front_to_back_sender.php', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ action: 'refresh_token' }),
      credentials: 'include' // Include cookies
    });

    const data = await response.json();

    if (data.status === 'success') {
      // Token refreshed, verify auth again
      await verifyAuth();
    } else if (data.status === 'error' && 
              (data.message?.includes('invalid') || data.message?.includes('expired'))) {
      // Only logout if refresh token is explicitly invalid or expired
      logout();
    }
    // For other errors, keep the user logged in if we have localStorage data
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Token refresh error:', err);
    // Don't logout on network errors
    // This is already correct
  }
};
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Backup the Current Code**:
   - Create a backup of the current `AuthContext.js` file before making changes

2. **Update the AuthContext.js File**:
   - Modify the `verifyAuth()` function as shown above
   - Modify the `refreshToken()` function as shown above

3. **Test the Changes**:
   - Test the application with the new changes
   - Verify that users remain logged in after page refresh
   - Test under various network conditions (good connection, poor connection, offline)

4. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Consider adding a visual indicator when the app is operating in "offline mode"
   - Implement a retry mechanism for failed authentication requests
   - Add proper error handling for specific error cases

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Functionality Testing**:
   - Login to the application
   - Refresh the page and verify that you remain logged in
   - Navigate to different protected routes and refresh the page

2. **Network Condition Testing**:
   - Test with the network disconnected (offline mode)
   - Test with slow network connections
   - Test with intermittent network connections

3. **Token Expiration Testing**:
   - Test with expired access tokens to ensure the refresh mechanism works
   - Test with expired refresh tokens to ensure proper logout

4. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Test with invalid tokens
   - Test with missing tokens
   - Test with corrupted localStorage data

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Security**:
   - Continue to store tokens in HTTP-only cookies for security
   - Only store non-sensitive user data in localStorage

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Always validate user data retrieved from localStorage before using it
   - Implement proper data sanitization

3. **Logout Mechanism**:
   - Ensure the logout function properly clears both cookies and localStorage
   - Implement a server-side logout mechanism to invalidate tokens
