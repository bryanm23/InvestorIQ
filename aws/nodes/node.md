1. Health Monitoring via RabbitMQ
Health Check Agents: Deploy small agents on each EC2 instance that periodically send heartbeat messages to a dedicated RabbitMQ queue
Dead Letter Exchange: Configure RabbitMQ to move messages to a dead letter queue if they're not acknowledged, which can indicate a failed instance
Monitoring Service: A lightweight service that consumes from the monitoring queue and detects missing heartbeats

2. RabbitMQ as the Command Center
Command Queue: Create a dedicated queue for failover commands
Topic Exchange: Use a topic exchange to route different types of failover commands (e.g., database failover, frontend failover)
Message Persistence: Ensure messages are persistent so they survive RabbitMQ restarts

3. Ansible Integration
Ansible Worker Service: Create a service that consumes from the command queue and executes appropriate Ansible playbooks
Dynamic Inventory: Use Ansible's dynamic inventory to track the current state of your EC2 instances
Playbook Structure: Create playbooks for:
Activating backup nodes
Deactivating backup nodes when primary returns
Synchronizing data between primary and backup

4. Implementation Steps
  1. RabbitMQ Configuration
  2. Health Check Agent
  3. Monitoring Service
  4. Ansible Worker
  5. Ansible Playbook

Ansible Proposed Approach

1. Installation: Install all necessary software on each VM during initial setup
2. Configuration: Configure backup services to remain inactive but ready
3. Activation: Use Ansible playbooks triggered by RabbitMQ to activate backup nodes when needed
4. Deactivation: Return to normal state when primary node recovers

2. RabbitMQ Backup Nodes

3. Frontend Backup Nodes

4. Backend Backup Nodes

5. Initial Setup Playbook
This playbook would be run once to set up all VMs with their primary and backup services:

6. Service Discovery and Configuration
To ensure backup nodes can seamlessly take over, you need a service discovery mechanism:

Virtual IP Addresses: Use floating IPs that can be reassigned during failover
DNS Updates: Update DNS records (e.g., with AWS Route 53) during failover
Configuration Files: Update configuration files with current active nodes

7. Handling State and Data
Database
Use MySQL replication to keep backup nodes in sync
Configure semi-synchronous replication for minimal data loss
RabbitMQ
Use mirrored queues to replicate messages across nodes
Configure persistent messages for durability
Frontend/Backend
Store session data in the database or a separate Redis instance
Use stateless design patterns where possible

8. Monitoring and Automatic Failover
As discussed earlier, RabbitMQ would be the central point for monitoring and triggering failover:

Health check agents send heartbeats to RabbitMQ
A monitoring service detects missing heartbeats
The monitoring service triggers Ansible playbooks via a command queue
Ansible activates the appropriate backup node
